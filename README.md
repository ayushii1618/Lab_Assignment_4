Pythonâ€“NumPy Practice

This repository is a collection of Python programs built using NumPy and core Python concepts. It is designed to provide hands-on practice with arrays, matrices, and numerical computations while also strengthening problem-solving skills in Python. The programs in this repo cover a wide range of topics including array manipulations, set operations, string handling, binary transformations, and matrix properties such as rank, trace, and determinant.

The goal of this repo is to help learners become comfortable with NumPy operations and understand how Python can be used to solve mathematical and logical problems effectively. Each file demonstrates a different concept, making it a useful resource for lab assignments, and self-practice.

By going through these programs, learners will not only revise basic Python but also gain confidence in working with NumPy arrays, linear algebra functions, and array transformations, which are fundamental in data science, AI, and engineering applications.
